## 📱 What is PingCode?

![PingCode](https://github.com/nalikiru-dev/pingcode/blob/main/assets/Logo.png)

**PingCode** is your ultra-portable code editor and compiler for **Android** and **iOS**. Designed specifically for **mobile and tablet devices**, it’s the closest thing to carrying your **Vim** or **VS Code** in your pocket.

Whether you’re on the train, on your couch, or deep in the mountains — **PingCode** brings the power of full-fledged development environments **anywhere** you go.

## 🧠 Why PingCode?

> "I wanted to fix a bug, but my laptop was dead. I just had my phone. I felt useless. Why?"  
> — Every Dev, at some point

Because the world runs on code — but code shouldn't run only on desktops.

PingCode changes that by giving developers the power to:

✅ Edit  
✅ Compile  
✅ Run  
✅ Save  
✅ Git Push

...right from your phone or tablet, using **real-world programming languages and tools.**
